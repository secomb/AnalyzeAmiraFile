# AnalyzeAmiraFile
Postprocessing of spatial graphs generated by Amira from image stacks of microvascular networks  
Program to read, process and write Amira spatial graph files (xxxx.Smt.SptGraph.am) and generate Network.dat files.  
A set of spatial graphs can be processed. A file called AnalyzeAmiraFileList.dat must be provided, with the number of files to be processed and a list of the files.  
Reading and writing procedures are based on http://www.csc.kth.se/~weinkauf/notes/amiramesh.html  
Processing includes the following:  
-rejecting edges that are too small in diameter  
-rejecting edges that form closed loops  
-removing very stubby terminal segments (which may be artifacts of image segmentation)  
-combining segments to reach a target length lthresh (must be set within the code)
